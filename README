USAGE: ./main.native csvfile float|int kruskal|markov [options]

VALID OPTIONS:

--matrix
This means that the csv file already represents a matrix of distances between
nodes.  If this flag isn't set, then we interpret the file as a list of points
in R^n, which we then translate into a matrix of distances.

--arg1=A

If this flag is set, then the first argument to the clustering algorithm will be
A. For Kruskal, this means it will cluster the data into A clusters.  For
Markov, this means the expansion parameter will be A. If the flag is absent, it
will default to 2 for Markov and N/2 for Kruskal (where N is the number of
nodes).

--arg2=B

If this flag is set, then the second argument to the clustering algorithm will
be B.  This is meaningless for Kruskal, which only takes one argument, so
Kruskal's algorithm will ignore this flag.

--has-labels

If this flag is set, then the csv file has labels in its first column. We take
this into account by skipping the first column during calculation, and then
using these labels as names for each node when we output the results.

--has-header

If this flag is set, then the csv file has category headers in its first row. We
take this into account by skipping the first row in our calculations.

--verbose

If this flag is set, then the Markov algorithm will print out the current matrix
on each iteration. This flag has no implications for Kruskal's algorithm.

--delim='C'

If this flag is set, then the csv file is separated by C instead of by commas.
For example, if a csv used semicolons to separate its data, then you would use
the option --delim=';' so that we can take this into account.
